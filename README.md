# DictionShellcode

Encode shellcode into dictionary words to avoid the usual shellcode XOR/AES encryption libraries/signatures and reduce payload entropy for increased evasion.<br />

Ultimately converts shellcode bytes to a word, stores plaintext words in your payload in place of shellcode, and decodes words to shellcode at runtime using a "translation dictionary" of shellcode words (bytes).<br />

The Python tool reads the `english-words.txt` file to pull random dictionary words to be encoded as shellcode bytes. This file can easily be modified or changed to another dictionary file of your choosing (i.e. Microsoft strings, postal/zip codes, whatever else).<br />

## Create dictionary encoded shellcode

Use `DictionShellcode.py` to encode your input shellcode file into dictionary word format.

```
> python3 DictionShellcode.py -h
usage: DictionShellcode.py [-h] [-file FILE] [-lang {cs,cpp}] [-rot] [-outfile OUTFILE]

Shellcode converter to Dictionary list

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -file FILE, -f FILE   Raw binary shellcode file for input
  -lang {cs,cpp}, -l {cs,cpp}
                        Output language format
  -outfile OUTFILE, -o OUTFILE
                        OPTIONAL: File output with encoded dictionary words separated by newlines
```

```

Upon execution, the encoded shellcode output will be copied to your clipboard in CSharp/C++ variable format or written to an output file if `-outfile` is provided. <br />


## Executing dictionary-encoded shellcode

Drop your dictionary wordlist from the output `translate_dict` variable and your dictionary-encoded shellcode `dict_words` variable into one of the provided payloads then compile/run to execute! <br />

**IMPORTANT:** For C++ payloads, you must update the `shellcode` length on line 24 to match the `dict_words` variable length!<br />
